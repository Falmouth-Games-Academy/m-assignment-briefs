\chapter{Marking Descriptors} \label{ch:rubrics}

Note that the assignments which constitute your Final Major Project are \textbf{not} marked in a criterion-based fashion.
Instead, your project supervisor will assign an overall grade by considering the following descriptors in relation to your project.

You \textbf{must} demonstrate success at every learning outcome in order to pass.
