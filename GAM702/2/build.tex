\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
"It isn't enough to pick a pathâ€”you must go down it. By doing so, you see things you couldn't possibly see when you started out; you may not like what you see, some of it may be confusing, but at least you will have, as we like to say, 'explored the neighborhood.' The key point here is that even if you decide you're in the wrong place, there is still time to head toward the right place."
-- Ed Catmull, Creativity Inc.

For this assignment you will create and maintain a blog that will detail your development process during the course of the module. The goal of the blog is to capture your development process and the lessons you have learned from each prototype. This blog is not simply a review of each game, but a critical evaluation of your process and practices.

You should make a minimum of \textbf{three posts per game}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item First post which details your initial thoughts about the brief and provides initial brainstorming
	\item Second post, which would usually be mid-way through development which updates the reader on the progress so far
	\item Third post, this reflects on the development of the prototype and details what you have learned so far
\end{itemize}

Before the final submission you should also make a post which contains the following

\begin{itemize}
	\item A rationale of why you selected the 3 prototypes for submission
	\item What lessons you have learned from the development of the 5 prototypes
	\item Reflect on what you have learned as Designer
	\item State how you would approach a hypothetical 6th prototype 
\end{itemize}

For the final submission you should provide a link to your blog to the submission area of the assignment on the Learning Space.

\subsection*{Peer and self Assessment}
After each formative submission you will be required to play a selection of prototypes produced by your peer and even your own game. It is required that you engage with
this process through out the module. Every piece of feedback should be constructive and actionable, in addition, a portion of your mark will be derived on how you engage with this
feedback process. 

\subsection*{Assignment Setup} 

This assignment consists of \textbf{five formative submissions}, followed by a \textbf{single summative submission}.

After each formative submission you will receive feedback from your peers and module tutor. You should note this feedback and feed this into subsequent prototypes.  

The formative submissions consists of a single zip file, with the following folder structure. You can also find a template zip file on the Assignment Space in the Learning Space

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
    		Falmouth University policy states that summative deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications.  
    		
	\item 	\textbf{How will I receive feedback on my work?} \\ 
    		You will be given verbal feedback on your work during the session in which it is marked.
    		If you require more in-depth feedback or discussion, please book an appointment with your tutor.
    		
    	\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\ 	
    		If you have discovered an issue with the brief itself, please inform the module tutor.
