\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
"It isn't enough to pick a pathâ€”you must go down it. By doing so, you see things you couldn't possibly see when you started out; you may not like what you see, some of it may be confusing, but at least you will have, as we like to say, 'explored the neighborhood.' The key point here is that even if you decide you're in the wrong place, there is still time to head toward the right place."
-- Ed Catmull, Creativity Inc.

For this assignment you will create and maintain a blog that will detail your development process during the course of the module. The goal of the blog is to capture your development process and the lessons you have learned from each prototype. This blog is not simply a review of each game, but a critical evaluation of your process and practices.

You should make a minimum of \textbf{three posts per game}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item First post which details your initial thoughts about the brief and provides initial brainstorming
	\item Second post, which would usually be mid-way through development which updates the reader on the progress so far
	\item Third post, this reflects on the development of the prototype and details what you have learned so far
\end{itemize}

Before the final submission you should also make a post which contains the following

\begin{itemize}
	\item A rationale of why you selected the 3 prototypes for submission
	\item What lessons you have learned from the development of the 5 prototypes
	\item Reflect on what you have learned as Designer
	\item State how you would approach a hypothetical 6th prototype 
\end{itemize}

For the final submission you should provide a link to your blog, to the submission area of the assignment on the Learning Space. 

\subsection*{Assignment Setup} 

To setup your blog, you should visit the following referral link \url{https://journal.falmouth.ac.uk/?join-invite-code=990-gam702}. This will guide you
through the creation of the blog and add you to the class list. Please ensure that you name the blog something sensible and you pick a theme which makes the blog clear and readable.

In addition, please upload your a URL of your blog to the LearningSpace to the \textbf{StudentBlog} area.

This assignment consists of \textbf{five formative submissions}, followed by a \textbf{single summative submission}.

After each formative submission you will receive feedback from your peers and module tutor. You should note this feedback and feed this into subsequent blog posts.  

The formative submissions consists of adding a link to the blog on the submission area on the Learning Space.


\section*{Additional Guidance}
